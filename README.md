## Hi there 👋

Hi — I’m Yanzhong (Eric) Huang, a quantitative researcher and developer currently pursuing my Master of Quantitative Finance at Rutgers Business School (Class of 2024). My work bridges finance, data science, and software engineering, with a focus on systematic investing and quantitative research.

I’ve built models and tools across the investment lifecycle — from multi-factor signal research and backtesting engines to portfolio optimizers and performance attribution frameworks. I’ve worked at hedge funds, asset managers, and quant startups, managing live portfolios and deploying tools used by over 500 clients. My recent roles include quant developer at Quantel AI and Sincere Digits, and fund analyst at Hongchou Investment.

- 👨‍🎓 current student in the Master of Quantitative Finance program at Rutgers Business School.
- 🎓 Master’s degree in Banking and Finance from Monash University.
- 💼 three years of experience as a quantitative analyst and developer.
